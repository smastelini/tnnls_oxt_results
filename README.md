## Repository organization

- `datasets`: evaluated datasets (data generators were also employed).
- `output`: folder with all the raw logs generated by the experiments.
- `src`: the scripts per se.

## Scripts

The main scripts are `run.py` (datasets stored in files), `run_drift.py` (generator-based data), and `saturation_study.py`. The file `baselines.py` could also be interesing to check. All the parameters of the experiments are centralized in the the `utils.py`.
The remaining scripts are used for generating plots, tables, and parsing the generated outputs.
